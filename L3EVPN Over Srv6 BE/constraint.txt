${loopback_ipv6_prefix}

Description: An integer for the prefix length of the loopback address.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Should be 128 to ensure it is a host address.

${core_interface_name}

Description: A string representing the physical interface identifier connected to the core network.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be a valid, existing interface on the device.

${core_interface_ipv6_address}

Description: A string representing the physical interface identifier connected to the customer (CE) device.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be a valid, existing interface on the device.

${vpn_name}

Description: A string for the name of the VPN instance (VRF).

Logical Constraints & Relationships: This name must be used consistently across the interface binding, BGP VRF config, and SRv6 service SID config on this device.

${ce_interface_ipv4_address}

Description: The IPv4 address for the CE-facing interface.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must belong to the same subnet as the interface of the CE router it connects to.

${rd_value} (Route Distinguisher)

Description: A string in the format ASN:Number or IPAddress:Number.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be unique for each VPN instance on this PE router to ensure prefixes remain distinct.

${rt_value} (Route Target)

Description: A string in the format ASN:Number.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: For a given VPN to function, a PE's exported routes (with its export-extcommunity) must be imported by other PEs. In a simple full-mesh VPN like the example, the import and export RT values are identical across all PEs in that VPN.

${isis_process_id}

Description: An integer that identifies the IS-IS routing process.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be identical on all routers (PE and P) participating in the same IS-IS domain.

${net_entity}

Description: The Network Entity Title for IS-IS, a string in a specific hexadecimal format.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be unique for each router within the IS-IS domain.

${bgp_as_number}

Description: An integer representing the Autonomous System number of the provider's network.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: This value is used for this PE's BGP process and as the remote_as for the CE's BGP configuration.

${bgp_router_id}

Description: A unique IPv4-formatted string that serves as the BGP router ID.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be unique across all routers in the BGP domain (both provider and customer, if they are in the same process view).

${remote_pe_address}

Description: The IPv6 loopback address of the remote PE router.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must exactly match the ${loopback_ipv6_address} of another PE device.

${ce_peer_address}

Description: The IPv4 address of the connected CE device's interface.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must exactly match the ${pe_interface_ipv4_address} on the CE device.

${ce_as_number}

Description: An integer representing the Autonomous System number of the customer's network.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be different from this device's ${bgp_as_number}. Must match the ${bgp_as_number} on the CE device.

${locator_name}

Description: A string that provides a unique, local name for the SRv6 locator.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: This name must be used consistently in the SRv6, IS-IS, and BGP sections of the same device's configuration.

P (Provider) Device Parameters
${loopback_ipv6_address}

Description: A unique, routable IPv6 address for the P router's loopback interface.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be unique within the IS-IS domain.

${interface1_ipv6_address}

Description: The IPv6 address for the interface connected to the first PE.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must belong to the same subnet as the ${core_interface_ipv6_address} of the PE it connects to.

${interface2_ipv6_address}

Description: The IPv6 address for the interface connected to the second PE.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must belong to the same subnet as the ${core_interface_ipv6_address} of the PE it connects to.

${isis_process_id}

Description: An integer that identifies the IS-IS routing process.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be identical to the process ID used on the PE devices.

${net_entity}

Description: The Network Entity Title for IS-IS.

Logical Constraints & Relationships: Must be unique for the P router within the IS-IS domain.

CE (Customer Edge) Device Parameters
${pe_interface_ipv4_address}
